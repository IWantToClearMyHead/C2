### Linux

For most users, C runs on Windows, Linux or MacOS, corresponding to Lenovo, Dell or Mac in hardware.

We are going to use Linux since it's ![open](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) source, and we can download ![here](https://www.kernel.org/).

The creator of Linux is Linus Torvalds, who mimiced Unix in 1991, thus name combined. 

As of 25 Nov 2021, he is 52 years old, since he was born at 28 December 1969. Yet Linux has a very vast history in terms of its version.

Less equal than 2.6, the version goes major.minor.modification-release cycle. Current version is 5.16-rc2, so there is no modification time, nor even represent stable.

### GNU

GNU's Not Unix! 

Linux is actually GNU/Linux, that is to say GNU is a bigger project. One may ask then what is GNU's OS? ![Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/).

On Linux, GNU is more like toolchain, includes the GNU Make, the GNU C Library, the GNU Debugger, and the GNU build system.

GCC is short for GNU Compiler Collection, and GDB is short for GNU Project.

At this point, we should recall who created such perfect tool, or toolchain?

Richard Stallman, collegue of Bill Gates, fights with ![FSF](https://my.fsf.org/join?mtm_campaign=frfall2021&mtm_source=appeal) alone in 1985, thus we can build bigger dream since it is free.

Besides, we should recall C father Dennis Ritchie, who was gone on October 12, 2011.
